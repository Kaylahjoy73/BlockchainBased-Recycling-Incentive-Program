# Blockchain-Based Recycling Incentive Program

A Clarity smart contract that implements a recycling incentive program where users earn tokens for recycling verified materials.

## Features

- Token rewards for recycling materials
- Material-specific reward rates
- Authorized verifier system
- Recycler statistics tracking
- Fungible token implementation

## Contract Functions

### Administrative Functions
- `initialize-material-rate`: Set reward rate for specific materials
- `set-verifier`: Update authorized verifier

### Core Functions
- `record-recycling`: Record recycling activity and mint rewards
- `transfer-tokens`: Transfer tokens between users

### Read-Only Functions
- `get-material-rate`: Check reward rate for materials
- `get-recycler-stats`: View recycler's statistics
- `get-balance`: Check token balance
- `get-verifier`: Get current authorized verifier

## Usage

1. Deploy the contract
2. Initialize material rates using `initialize-material-rate`
3. Verifiers can record recycling using `record-recycling`
4. Users can transfer tokens using `transfer-tokens`

## Testing

Use Clarinet to run tests:
```bash
clarinet test
```

## Security

Only authorized verifiers can record recycling activities and mint tokens.
